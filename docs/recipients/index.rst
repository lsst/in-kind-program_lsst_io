##########
Recipients
##########

The group for which the contribution is designed, and in which the contribution and the contributing team is “embedded”.
The recipients are typically LSST science collaborations, Rubin Observatory teams, or Rubin’s operating partners (NOIRLab and SLAC).
There may be more than one recipient group for any contribution: the primary recipients are responsible for the direction and tracking of the work and their feedback carries most weight.
The other recipient groups are referred to as secondary recipients.
