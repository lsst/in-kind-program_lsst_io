Contributed Datasets
####################

This webpage lists the complementary data sets expected to be made available to the Rubin Community via the Vera C. Rubin In-kind Program.
For each contribution, the title, a summary, and the primary recipient of the contribution are provided.
The majority of the contributions have not yet started, or are in an early phase. This information will be periodically updated as the datasets become available.

Please email the in-kind helpdesk JIKH at lsst dot org if you have any questions about contributed datasets.


**The LSST sources detected by eROSITA (GER-MPE-S3)**

MPE will generate and curate eROSITA-LSST value-added catalogs for the AGN that the LSST collaboration will identify, using public eROSITA data that MPE itself is responsible for.

Primary Recipient: LSST AGN Science Collaboration


**ULTRASAT all-sky UV maps (ISR-UST-S2)**

Rubin community will have access to the ULTRASAT all-sky map produced in the first six-months of operation for at least 12 months prior to the public data release

Primary Recipient: NOIRLab CSDC


**The Son of X-Shooter contribution to Rubin: a set of 2,000 spectra for Machine Learning light curve classification (ITA-INA-S16)**

INAF will deliver 2,000 spectra obtained with SOXS from LSST targets. Deliverables are the entire data acquired for the targets, including 1-D extracted spectra and spectral classification.

Primary Recipient: TVS


**A Cluster Spectroscopy Hub for galaxy cluster science with LSST (ITA-INA-S17)**

We propose to share a vast spectroscopic database on galaxy clusters, complemented with physical metadata and other imaging (ground-based and HST) data-products, with the LSST community,
effectively creating a Cluster Spectroscopy Hub for the exploitation of LSST data for a range of cluster science cases.

Primary Recipient: NOIRLab CSDC


**A VST surveys to support the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (ITA-INA-S27)**

We propose to use 80 nights/year of VST time from 2026 until 2032 (with a possible extension to 2036) to execute a support survey with VST,
to complement the LSST dataset improving the light curve sampling of transient and variable sources, and to deliver the data to the US/Chilean communities before they are made public.

Primary Recipient: TBD


**Exploiting the synergy between LSST and VST to investigate the cosmos: the expansion rate and the geometry of the Universe measured through the time delays of strongly lensed variable sources. (ITA-INA-S28)**

We propose to use 4620 hours (i.e., 577.5 nights) of VST time over 7 years to complement the LSST dataset improving the light curve sampling of transient
and variable sources strongly lensed by galaxies and galaxy clusters, and to deliver the data to the US/Chilean communities before they are made public.

Primary Recipient: TBD (TVS?)


**Toward next-generation time-domain surveys (TIMEDOMES): VST monitoring of the LSST Deep Drilling Fields (ITA-INA-S29)**

We propose to use 170 hours/year of VST time to execute a precursorsurvey with VST, to complement and extend in time the LSST dataset on 4 DDF,
and to combine these observations with all archival data to deliver reduced images, catalogs and lightcurves lasting up to >10 years to the US/Chilean communities.

Primary Recipient: TBD


**Subaru PFS spectroscopic follow-up survey of LSST transients in deep drilling field (JAP-JPG-S10)**

JPG will deliver the data products from the Subaru PFS spectroscopic follow-up survey of LSST transients in drilling fields, to be ingested into Kavli IPMU Lite IDAC.

Primary Recipient: DESC


**Subaru PFS filler survey for LSST photo-z training dataset (JAP-JPG-S11)**

The activity offered by JPG would involve the development of a target selection algorithm in close collaboration with Rubin Photo-z Coordination Group and/or DESC,
the observation and data analysis, the ingestion of the dataset into Kavli IPMU Lite IDAC with NOIRLab CSDC, and finally the scientific application
of the dataset to improve photo-z accuracy of LSST photometric redshifts.

Primary Recipient: DESC


**Contribution to the LSST photo-z calibration with PFS-SSP galaxy evolution dataset (JAP-JPG-S12)**

JPG will deliver the data products of PFS-SSP, based upon approval from the PFS-SSP team, to the LSST community for photo-z calibration and training datasets.

Primary Recipient: DESC


**The MOA Archive: a legacy dataset of two decades of photometry across the Galactic Bulge and Magellanic Clouds (NZL-AUK-S2)**

The MOA archive will be ingested into a locally maintained server that will provide image cutouts at the start of the LSST survey and machine calibrated photometry
12 months after the beginning of the survey, giving high cadence coverage of the Galactic Bulge and Magellanics dating back to 2006.

Primary Recipients: NOIRLab


**Supernova Lightcurves and low-resolution spectra for Full-sky Low-redshift Cosmography Complementing LSST (SWE-STK-S4)**

SU will provide online data file access (anticipated to be hosted at NOIRLab) whereby it is possible for LSST users to download the photometry and spectroscopy tables for each ZTF/ZTF-II SN
(or the entire set at once), as well as the ancillary information about the host galaxy environment. We will provide machine readable files, including standard formats used by lightcurve fitters
(SALT2, SNooPy) and FITS tables.

Primary Recipient: DESC


**LSST-matched MIGHTEE data (UKD-OXF-S7)**

The activity offered by Oxford would involve installation of the MIGHTEE Survey data at the UK DAC, and subsequently,
joint work with the LSST Science Collaborations in training photo-z (based on HI data and the incorporation of radio continuum and polarisation data) as well as
user support for the LSST Science Community to facilitate the use of the Survey data.

Primary Recipient: NOIRLab CSDC


**Science Software development: Near infrared data fusion (UKD-UKD-S5)**

LSST:UK will provide joint LSST+VISTA near infra-red catalogues produced using the LSST Stack and access to VISTA survey images as a dataset contribution,
as well as an implementation of the LSST Stack pipeline reconfigured to jointly process LSST pixels with external survey pixels.

Primary Recipient: NOIRLab CSDC


**Science Software development: spectroscopic classification of transients and 4MOST spectra (UKD-UKD-S10)**

To provide non-directable software development effort to the LSST DESC for transient spectroscopic follow-up,
developing software to ensure successful scheduling and observation of transients and their host galaxies by 4MOST,
and the return the transient types and redshifts to the collaboration (through the Lasair broker, within 24hrs)
and the final calibrated spectra as contributed data sets on an annual basis.

Primary Recipient: DESC


**MeerKAT high-level data products and services for LSST (SZA-SAA-S2)**

South Africa will produce reduced high-level data products (images and catalogs) and services for MeerKAT data,
as endorsed by the Galaxies Science Collaboration, integrated into the Rubin Science Platform.

Primary Recipients: Galaxies
