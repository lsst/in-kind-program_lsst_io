Now Available

SER-SAG-S1
Two nights per month are available on the 1.4 Milankovic Telescope located at Astronomical Station Vidojevica near Prokuplje, Serbia.
Optical Imaging is available with the Andor iKon-L 936 CCD and the following filters: Johnson B, V, R, I, L, filters and Hα , Hα continuum and SII.
This facility offers AEON compatibility and is available for target of opportunity observations. Observations are taken in service mode.
Raw data will be available within 24 hours and fully reduced and calibrated data within 72 hours. This contribution was first made available in Semester 2025A and is expected to be available for a total of 10 years.

SWE-STK-S3
70 hours of observing time on the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) is available for supernova classification using the ALFOSC instrument. NOT is a 2.56m telescope located on La Palma, Spain.
The Alhambra Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera, ALFOSC, offers low/medium spectroscopy. Successful PIs will be able to submit ToO triggers of potential SNe for classification.
Fully reduced spectra will be uploaded to WISeREP/TNS within 48 hours of observation. This contribution was first made available in Semester 2025A and is expected to be available for a total of 4 semesters.
