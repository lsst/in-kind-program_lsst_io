43 teams outside the US and Chile are making in-kind contributions to Rubin Observatory and LSST Science in return for LSST data rights.
The International Data Rights Holder list contains all those nominated by international programs for LSST data rights.
Find out more about this large international collaboration below and at the links in the sidebar.

In addition, we have compiled an extensive list of In-kind Program FAQs and you can also browse the LSST community forum using the in-kind tag: https://community.lsst.org/tag/in-kind.

The In-kind Program spans many varied contributions providing resources and support to Rubin Operations and the Rubin Science Community.
The Rubin LSST Science Collaborations support the CEC and In-kind Program Coordination (IPC) teams in management of the In-kind contributions with their scientific expertise.

The in-kind program is managed collectively by the international programs' Program Managers (PMs),
facilitated by the Rubin In-kind Program Coordination Team which reports to the Rubin Director and Deputy Director of Operations.
